    howPrediwinWorksQuestion: 'How does Prediwin work?',
    howPrediwinWorksAnswer: 'Prediwin.com is a predictions platform that offers two main experiences. The first are Public pots, which are prediction competitions where users make daily predictions on global events. Each pot has its own timeline controlled by the number of participants still in the tournament - tournaments automatically reach their final day once player count drops below 10. Entry fees increase based on days since the pot started (not calendar days). Players get eliminated daily for making a wrong prediction and may choose to re-enter by paying the current entry fee. The second are Private pots, which allow you to create your own custom prediction topics and invite friends to join by sharing a link.',
    dynamicPricingPublicPotsQuestion: 'How does dynamic pricing work for Public pots?',
    dynamicPricingPublicPotsAnswer: 'Public pots use individual pot timers with dynamic pricing based on days since each pot started. Entry fees follow this structure: Days 1-4 have fixed early pricing ($0.02, $0.03, $0.04, $0.05 USD in ETH). Starting on day 5, fees begin at $0.10 USD and double each subsequent day. Each pot has its own independent timeline controlled by the number of participants still in the tournament - tournaments automatically reach their final day once player count drops below 10. Private pots let you set any entry fee you want.',
    wrongPredictionQuestion: 'What happens if I make a wrong prediction?',
    wrongPredictionAnswer: 'In Public pots: If you predict incorrectly, you\'ll be eliminated but can re-enter by paying the current day\'s entry fee. The goal is to stay in the tournament until it reaches its final day (which happens automatically when player count drops below 10) and winners are determined. In Private pots: The pot creator decides the final date, outcome and winners - you cannot re-enter a private pot after the winners have been determined.',
    privatePotsQuestion: 'What are Private pots and how do they work?',
    privatePotsAnswer: 'Private pots are custom prediction pots you create on any topic - crypto prices, sports outcomes, world events, or fun questions with friends. As the creator, you set the entry fee, invite participants via a shareable link, and decide the winners. It\'s perfect for friend groups, teams, or communities who want their own prediction competitions.',
    createSharePrivatePotQuestion: 'How do I create and share a Private pot?',
    createSharePrivatePotAnswer: 'Go to "Private pots" in the navigation menu, set your pot name and description, then deploy it for minimal gas fees (~$0.01-0.05 on Base). You\'ll receive a shareable URL that you can send to friends via text, social media, or email. Anyone with the link can join your pot by paying the entry fee you set.',
    controlPrivatePotsQuestion: 'Who controls Private pots?',
    controlPrivatePotsAnswer: 'As the pot creator, you have full control. You set the entry amount, manage participants, decide when to close entries, determine the winning outcome, and distribute rewards to winners. The platform provides tools to see all participants and their predictions in a beautiful interface.',
    privatePotParticipantsQuestion: 'How do Private pot participants join?',
    privatePotParticipantsAnswer: 'Friends click your shared link, connect their wallet, pay the entry fee in ETH, and make their prediction. They can see all other participants (by wallet address or email if submitted), entry amounts, and prediction status. It\'s fully transparent so everyone can see who predicted what.',
    needEthereumQuestion: 'Why do I need Ethereum to place predictions?',
    needEthereumAnswer: 'You need ETH for gas fees on the Base network (usually ~$0.01-0.05 per transaction). This covers the blockchain transaction costs for entering pots, making predictions, and claiming winnings. You\'ll also need ETH to pay the actual pot\'s entry fees.',
    entryFeesCalculationQuestion: 'How are entry fees calculated in Public pots?',
    entryFeesCalculationAnswer: 'Public pots follow a dynamic pricing model based on days since each pot started (not calendar days). Days 1-4 have fixed pricing: $0.02, $0.03, $0.04, $0.05 USD in ETH. After day 4, fees begin to double starting at $0.10 USD on day 5, then $0.20 on day 6, $0.40 on day 7, and so on. Each pot has its own independent timeline. Private pots let you set any entry fee you want.',
    referralSystemQuestion: 'How does the referral system work?',
    referralSystemAnswer: 'Each user gets a unique 8-character referral code. When 3 friends succesfully enter pots using your code, you earn 1 free pot entry. This system includes fraud protection to ensure legitimate referrals and works for both Public and Private pots.',
    eventTypesQuestion: 'What types of events can I predict?',
    eventTypesAnswer: 'Public pots cover cryptocurrency prices, stock movements, sports, and world events. Private pots are unlimited - create pots on anything: "Will it rain tomorrow?", "Who wins the office fantasy league?", "Will our friend get the job?", crypto prices, sports bets with friends, or any measurable outcome you can think of.',
    makePredictionsQuestion: 'How do I make predictions?',
    makePredictionsAnswer: 'After entering a pot, you choose YES or NO for the outcome (or positive/negative for price movements). In Public pots, you can make one prediction per day and update it before cutoff. In Private pots, you typically make one prediction per pot topic set by the creator.',
    winnersQuestion: 'When and how are winners determined?',
    winnersAnswer: 'Public pots: Winners are determined when tournaments reach their final day (automatically triggered when player count drops below 10), based on actual event results. Private pots: The pot creator decides when to close predictions, determines the actual outcome, and distributes rewards to winners through the smart contract.',
    getWinningsQuestion: 'How do I get my winnings?',
    getWinningsAnswer: 'Winnings are automatically distributed through smart contracts on the Base network. Once you\'re determined as a winner, the ETH is sent directly to your connected wallet - no manual claiming required. This works the same for both Public and Private pots.',
    withoutCryptoExperienceQuestion: 'Can I participate without crypto experience?',
    withoutCryptoExperienceAnswer: 'Not yet! The platform includes a comprehensive 5-step tutorial and a built-in buy page where you can easily purchase ETH using Coinbase OnChainKit. The interface is designed to be user-friendly for crypto beginners. We recommend users familiarize themselves with basic crypto concepts like wallets, gas fees, and ETH before participating.',
    livePotsQuestion: 'What are Live pots?',
    livePotsAnswer: 'Live pots are hourly prediction rounds that activate after entering a live pot. Once you pay the entry fee, you\'ll participate in structured hourly question sessions covering various topics. It\'s a time-based format designed for users who enjoy regular prediction challenges with scheduled results every hour.',
    gamblingQuestion: 'Is this gambling?',
    gamblingAnswer: 'Prediwin is a prediction pot platform focused on forecasting skills rather than gambling. Users make informed predictions about real-world events using their knowledge and analysis, similar to platforms like Polymarket or Kalshi. Private pots add a social element where friends compete on topics they care about.',

    howPrediwinWorksQuestion: 'Como funciona o Prediwin?',
    howPrediwinWorksAnswer: 'Prediwin.com é uma plataforma de previsões que oferece duas experiências principais. A primeira são Potes Públicos, que são competições de previsões onde usuários fazem previsões diárias sobre eventos globais. Cada pote tem sua própria linha do tempo controlada pelo número de participantes ainda no torneio - torneios automaticamente chegam ao dia final quando a contagem de jogadores cai abaixo de 10. Taxas de entrada aumentam baseadas nos dias desde que o pote começou (não dias do calendário). Jogadores são eliminados diariamente por fazer uma previsão errada e podem escolher re-entrar pagando a taxa de entrada atual. A segunda são Potes Privados, que permitem criar seus próprios tópicos de previsão personalizados e convidar amigos para participar compartilhando um link.',
    dynamicPricingPublicPotsQuestion: 'Como funciona o preço dinâmico para Potes Públicos?',
    dynamicPricingPublicPotsAnswer: 'Potes Públicos usam cronômetros individuais de pote com preços dinâmicos baseados nos dias desde que cada pote começou. Taxas de entrada seguem esta estrutura: Dias 1-4 têm preços fixos iniciais ($0.02, $0.03, $0.04, $0.05 USD em ETH). Começando no dia 5, taxas começam em $0.10 USD e dobram a cada dia subsequente. Cada pote tem sua própria linha do tempo independente controlada pelo número de participantes ainda no torneio - torneios automaticamente chegam ao dia final quando a contagem de jogadores cai abaixo de 10. Potes Privados permitem definir qualquer taxa de entrada que quiser.',
    wrongPredictionQuestion: 'O que acontece se eu fizer uma previsão errada?',
    wrongPredictionAnswer: 'Em Potes Públicos: Se você prever incorretamente, será eliminado mas pode re-entrar pagando a taxa de entrada do dia atual. O objetivo é permanecer no torneio até chegar ao dia final (que acontece automaticamente quando a contagem de jogadores cai abaixo de 10) e vencedores são determinados. Em Potes Privados: O criador do pote decide a data final, resultado e vencedores - você não pode re-entrar em um pote privado após os vencedores terem sido determinados.',
    privatePotsQuestion: 'O que são Potes Privados e como funcionam?',
    privatePotsAnswer: 'Potes Privados são potes de previsão personalizados que você cria sobre qualquer tópico - preços de cripto, resultados esportivos, eventos mundiais, ou perguntas divertidas com amigos. Como criador, você define a taxa de entrada, convida participantes via link compartilhável, e decide os vencedores. É perfeito para grupos de amigos, equipes, ou comunidades que querem suas próprias competições de previsão.',
    createSharePrivatePotQuestion: 'Como criar e compartilhar um Pote Privado?',
    createSharePrivatePotAnswer: 'Vá para "Potes privados" no menu de navegação, defina o nome e descrição do pote, depois implante por taxas mínimas de gás (~$0.01-0.05 na Base). Você receberá uma URL compartilhável que pode enviar para amigos via mensagem, redes sociais, ou email. Qualquer pessoa com o link pode entrar no seu pote pagando a taxa de entrada que você definiu.',
    controlPrivatePotsQuestion: 'Quem controla os Potes Privados?',
    controlPrivatePotsAnswer: 'Como criador do pote, você tem controle total. Você define o valor da entrada, gerencia participantes, decide quando fechar entradas, determina o resultado vencedor, e distribui recompensas aos vencedores. A plataforma fornece ferramentas para ver todos os participantes e suas previsões em uma interface bonita.',
    privatePotParticipantsQuestion: 'Como participantes de Potes Privados entram?',
    privatePotParticipantsAnswer: 'Amigos clicam no seu link compartilhado, conectam sua carteira, pagam a taxa de entrada em ETH, e fazem sua previsão. Eles podem ver todos os outros participantes (por endereço de carteira ou email se enviado), valores de entrada, e status da previsão. É totalmente transparente então todos podem ver quem previu o quê.',
    needEthereumQuestion: 'Por que preciso de Ethereum para fazer previsões?',
    needEthereumAnswer: 'Você precisa de ETH para taxas de gás na rede Base (geralmente ~$0.01-0.05 por transação). Isso cobre os custos de transação blockchain para entrar em potes, fazer previsões, e reivindicar ganhos. Você também precisará de ETH para pagar as taxas de entrada reais do pote.',
    entryFeesCalculationQuestion: 'Como são calculadas as taxas de entrada em Potes Públicos?',
    entryFeesCalculationAnswer: 'Potes Públicos seguem um modelo de preços dinâmicos baseado nos dias desde que cada pote começou (não dias do calendário). Dias 1-4 têm preços fixos: $0.02, $0.03, $0.04, $0.05 USD em ETH. Após o dia 4, taxas começam a dobrar começando em $0.10 USD no dia 5, depois $0.20 no dia 6, $0.40 no dia 7, e assim por diante. Cada pote tem sua própria linha do tempo independente. Potes Privados permitem definir qualquer taxa de entrada que quiser.',
    referralSystemQuestion: 'Como funciona o sistema de indicação?',
    referralSystemAnswer: 'Cada usuário recebe um código de indicação único de 8 caracteres. Quando 3 amigos entram com sucesso em potes usando seu código, você ganha 1 entrada gratuita de pote. Este sistema inclui proteção contra fraude para garantir indicações legítimas e funciona tanto para Potes Públicos quanto Privados.',
    eventTypesQuestion: 'Que tipos de eventos posso prever?',
    eventTypesAnswer: 'Potes Públicos cobrem preços de criptomoedas, movimentos de ações, esportes, e eventos mundiais. Potes Privados são ilimitados - crie potes sobre qualquer coisa: "Vai chover amanhã?", "Quem ganha o campeonato de fantasia do escritório?", "Nosso amigo vai conseguir o emprego?", preços de cripto, apostas esportivas com amigos, ou qualquer resultado mensurável que possa pensar.',
    makePredictionsQuestion: 'Como faço previsões?',
    makePredictionsAnswer: 'Depois de entrar em um pote, você escolhe SIM ou NÃO para o resultado (ou positivo/negativo para movimentos de preço). Em Potes Públicos, você pode fazer uma previsão por dia e atualizá-la antes do prazo. Em Potes Privados, você tipicamente faz uma previsão por tópico do pote definido pelo criador.',
    winnersQuestion: 'Quando e como os vencedores são determinados?',
    winnersAnswer: 'Potes Públicos: Vencedores são determinados quando torneios chegam ao dia final (automaticamente acionado quando a contagem de jogadores cai abaixo de 10), baseado nos resultados reais do evento. Potes Privados: O criador do pote decide quando fechar previsões, determina o resultado real, e distribui recompensas aos vencedores através do contrato inteligente.',
    getWinningsQuestion: 'Como recebo meus ganhos?',
    getWinningsAnswer: 'Ganhos são automaticamente distribuídos através de contratos inteligentes na rede Base. Uma vez determinado como vencedor, o ETH é enviado diretamente para sua carteira conectada - não é necessário reivindicação manual. Isso funciona igual tanto para Potes Públicos quanto Privados.',
    withoutCryptoExperienceQuestion: 'Posso participar sem experiência em cripto?',
    withoutCryptoExperienceAnswer: 'Ainda não! A plataforma inclui um tutorial abrangente de 5 passos e uma página de compra integrada onde você pode facilmente comprar ETH usando Coinbase OnChainKit. A interface é projetada para ser amigável para iniciantes em cripto. Recomendamos que usuários se familiarizem com conceitos básicos de cripto como carteiras, taxas de gás, e ETH antes de participar.',
    livePotsQuestion: 'O que são Potes Ao Vivo?',
    livePotsAnswer: 'Potes Ao Vivo são rodadas de previsão de hora em hora que se ativam após entrar em um pote ao vivo. Uma vez que você paga a taxa de entrada, participará de sessões de perguntas estruturadas por hora cobrindo vários tópicos. É um formato baseado em tempo projetado para usuários que gostam de desafios regulares de previsão com resultados programados a cada hora.',
    gamblingQuestion: 'Isso é jogo de azar?',
    gamblingAnswer: 'Prediwin é uma plataforma de potes de previsão focada em habilidades de previsão ao invés de jogos de azar. Usuários fazem previsões informadas sobre eventos do mundo real usando seu conhecimento e análise, similar a plataformas como Polymarket ou Kalshi. Potes Privados adicionam um elemento social onde amigos competem em tópicos que se importam.',
